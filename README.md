# Haskell Fluent

This is a collection of Haskell libraries implementing [Project Fluent][],
a localization system designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language translations.

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.
The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.
At the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.
